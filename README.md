HomeRanges
==========

This repository contains R source files used for analyzing white-faced capuchin home ranges.

The raw data are not posted because I don't own them all. [Contact me](mailto:camposfa@gmail.com) if you are interested in the data sets referred to in the source files.

Other files:
- **HomeRanges.R**: The primary source code for preparing and analyzing the data
- **Models.R**: Source code for applying the linear-mixed effects model analysis
- **Plots.R**: Source code for creating most of the plots
- **HomeRanges.Rmd**: R markdown file used to generate an HTML report (see below)
- **HRModels.Rmd**: R markdown file used to generate an HTML report (see below)
- **BRBMethod.R**: contains a function to batch-apply the biased random bridge home range method in the package adehabitatHR

Full instructions for reproducing the analysis can be found in the the HTML report: http://www.ucalgary.ca/~facampos/data/homerange/
